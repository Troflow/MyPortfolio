---------------------------------------------
What to include in the <head> tag when using Bootstrap: 

1. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
  This is a directive to tell the browser to use the entire width availible to it
  to prevent some mobile phones to include borders you don't want. 
  
2. <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css">
   This a simple link tag to include the pre-defined set of css styles from bootstrap. Include first
   before any of custom styles you make yourself. 
   
3. <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
   This is jQuery functions that is needed for bootstrap javascript to work. 
   
4. <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
   This includes the javascript provided from bootstrap. Include the jQuery tag before this 
   because the bootstrap js requires jQuery. If you're site doesn't need the interactive features
   from bootstrap then neither are needed. 

--------------------
5. <meta charset="UTF-8">
   This language tag is required for any html page along with a <title> tag.
