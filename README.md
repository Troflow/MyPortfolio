What to include in the <head> tag when using Bootstrap: 

1. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
  
  This directive instructs the browser to use the entire width available
  to prevent some mobile phones from including undesirable borders. 
  
2. <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css">
   
   This a simple link tag to include the pre-defined set of css styles from bootstrap. Include this tag before including any custom styles. 
   
3. <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
   
   This is a jQuery function that is needed for bootstrap javascript to work. 
   
4. <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
   
   This includes the javascript provided from bootstrap. Include the jQuery tag before this 
   because the bootstrap js requires jQuery. If your website does not need the interactive features
   from bootstrap then neither the javascript or the jQuery tag are needed. 

--------------------
5. <meta charset="UTF-8">
   
   This language tag is required for any html page along with a <title> tag.
